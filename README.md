# CS540 Project 1: Kingâ€™s Knightmare
Project was done in my 2nd semester of Sophomore year for my class CS540 Artificial Intelligence. The goal of the project was to program a Depth-First Search, Beadth-First Search and A*Star search to find the optimal sequence of moves for a Knight to capture the King on a modified chessboard.
